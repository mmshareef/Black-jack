Black Jack Game Algorithm:

-->  Can played between 2 players to n players.

-->  Shuffle the deck.

-->  Each player will have two cards from the deck.

-->  Essentially, players are dealt a starting hand of 2 cards with the hopes 
     of getting to the magical number of 21, or to get as close to 21 as possible.

-->  If a player gets 21 on his initial hand, it is called a "blackjack" or a "natural".

-->  The player wins, unless the house reaches blackjack as well.

--> The other ways to win are to hold a higher sum of cards at the end of the play
    than the house, or to have the house go over 21.

-->  It will have two options 'Hitme' and 'Stay'.

-->  HitMe means to draw one card from the deck.

--> Stay means no need to draw the card from the deck.

--> While Player, drawn the card from deck. If the sum is more than 21 he has brusted out,
    and the other player's whose sum of the card is more is the winner.
